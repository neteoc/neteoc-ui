## To get started:

(if on M$ Windows) Install git for windows, you will need **git bash.**: https://git-scm.com/download/win

Install AWS CLI: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html

Setup an AWS creds profile with: `aws cli configure --profile neteoc`

Install Terraform: https://www.terraform.io/intro/getting-started/install.html

Install node.js and npm: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/

Clone this repo then:

`npm install`          -> installs dependencies

`npm start`          -> starts a devlopment server on port 8080 and watches for changes

## File Structure
We use a componentized approach with NG6. This will be the eventual standard (and particularly helpful, if using 
Angular's new router) as well as a great way to ensure a tasteful transition to Angular 2, when the time is ripe. 
Everything--or mostly everything, as we'll explore (below)--is a component. A component is a self-contained 
concern--may it be a feature or strictly-defined, ever-present element of the UI (such as a header, sidebar, or 
footer). Also characteristic of a component is that it harnesses its own stylesheets, templates, controllers, routes, 
services, and specs. This encapsulation allows us the comfort of isolation and structural locality. Here's how it 
looks:
```
client
⋅⋅app/
⋅⋅⋅⋅app.js * app entry file
⋅⋅⋅⋅app.html * app template
⋅⋅⋅⋅common/ * functionality pertinent to several components propagate into this directory
⋅⋅⋅⋅components/ * where components live
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅components.js * components entry file
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅home/ * home component
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅home.js * home entry file (routes, configurations, and declarations occur here)
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅home.component.js * home "directive"
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅home.controller.js * home controller
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅home.scss * home styles
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅home.html * home template
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅home.spec.js * home specs (for entry, component, and controller)
```

## Testing Setup
All tests are also written in ES6. We use Webpack to take care of the logistics of getting those files to run in the various browsers, just like with our client files. This is our testing stack:
* Karma
* Webpack + Babel
* Mocha
* Chai

To run tests, type `npm test` in the terminal. Read more about testing [below](#testing).

# Getting Started
## Dependencies
Tools needed to run this app:
* `node` and `npm`

## Installing
* `fork` this repo
* `clone` your fork
* `npm install` to install dependencies

## Running the App
NG6 uses Gulp to build and launch the development environment. After you have installed all dependencies, you may run the app. Running `npm start` will bundle the app with `webpack`, launch a development server, and watch all files. The port will be displayed in the terminal.
 

### Tasks
Here's a list of available tasks:
* `npm run build`
  * runs Webpack, which will transpile, concatenate, and compress (collectively, "bundle") all assets and modules into `dist/bundle.js`. It also prepares `index.html` to be used as application entry point, links assets and created dist version of our application.
* `npm run serve`
  * starts a dev server via `webpack-dev-server`, serving the client folder.
* `npm run watch`
  * alias of `serve`
* `npm start` (which is the default task that runs when typing `gulp` without providing an argument)
  * runs `serve`.
* `npm run component`
  * scaffolds a new Angular component. [Read below](#generating-components) for usage details.
  
### Testing
To run the tests, run `npm test`.

`Karma` combined with Webpack runs all files matching `*.spec.js` inside the `app` folder. This allows us to keep test files local to the component--which keeps us in good faith with continuing to build our app modularly. The file `spec.bundle.js` is the bundle file for **all** our spec files that Karma will run.

Be sure to define your `*.spec.js` files within their corresponding component directory. You must name the spec file like so, `[name].spec.js`. If you don't want to use the `.spec.js` suffix, you must change the `regex` in `spec.bundle.js` to look for whatever file(s) you want.
`Mocha` is the testing suite and `Chai` is the assertion library. If you would like to change this, see `karma.conf.js`.



### Generating Components
Following a consistent directory structure between components offers us the certainty of predictability. We can take advantage of this certainty by creating a gulp task to automate the "instantiation" of our components. The component boilerplate task generates this:
```
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅componentName/
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅componentName.js // entry file where all its dependencies load
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅componentName.component.js
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅componentName.controller.js
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅componentName.html
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅componentName.scss // scoped to affect only its own template
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅componentName.spec.js // contains passing demonstration tests
```

You may, of course, create these files manually, every time a new module is needed, but that gets quickly tedious.
To generate a component, run `npm run component -- --name componentName`.

The parameter following the `--name` flag is the name of the component to be created. Ensure that it is unique or it will overwrite the preexisting identically-named component.

The component will be created, by default, inside `client/app/components`. To change this, apply the `--parent` flag, followed by a path relative to `client/app/components/`.

For example, running `npm run component -- --name signup --parent auth` will create a `signup` component at `client/app/components/auth/signup`.  

Running `npm run component -- --name footer --parent ../common` creates a `footer` component at `client/app/common/footer`.  

Because the argument to `--name` applies to the folder name **and** the actual component name, make sure to camelcase the component names.
